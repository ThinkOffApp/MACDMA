# KV handoff over MCDMA

A decoder on the Mac can have a CUDA machine prefill long prompts and then pull the resulting KV cache over an MCDMA
link. The producer is vLLM with the connector in `integrations/vllm/mcdma_kv`; oMLX's remote prefill is a decoder
that speaks this protocol. Both ends use `mcdma-rpcd` links, so neither application opens a verbs context.

Status: offline-tested with this repository's checks and against oMLX's decoder over a stand-in link. It has not yet
run on hardware or inside vLLM.

## Setting up vLLM

1. Install `mcdma-rpcd` and `libmcdma-rpc` on the vLLM host (see [link daemon](link-daemon.md)) and start one listen
   daemon per tensor-parallel rank, owned by the user vLLM runs as. Give each link a reply half large enough for
   several page rows of one layer; 64 MiB suits most models.
2. Put `integrations/vllm` on vLLM's `PYTHONPATH`, or copy `mcdma_kv` into its environment.
3. Start vLLM with the connector as a producer, naming the links in rank order:

```bash
vllm serve MODEL --kv-transfer-config '{"kv_connector": "MCDMAKVConnector",
  "kv_connector_module_path": "mcdma_kv.connector", "kv_role": "kv_producer",
  "kv_connector_extra_config": {"links": ["worker-a"]}}'
```

On the Mac, the connect daemon needs a peer entry for each of those links.

Extra settings: `export_ttl_s` (default 120) frees a handoff the decoder never closed, and `max_layers` exports only
layers below that index, for models whose drafter layers share the cache.

## What a request does

A decoder sends an ordinary completion request with the prompt's token IDs and

```json
"kv_transfer_params": {"mcdma_handoff": {"id": "<32 hex digits>", "export_from": 0}}
```

The connector limits the request to one generated token. When the step that finishes the prompt ends, each rank
records an export of its pages from `export_from` on, rounded down to a page row, and vLLM keeps the request's blocks
allocated. The rank's serving thread then answers the decoder over its link. Blocks are released when the decoder
closes the handoff, or after `export_ttl_s`.

Supported caches: full attention and MLA layers in bf16, fp16 or fp32. Sliding-window, Mamba and fp8 caches are
refused with an explanation the decoder receives.

## Protocol 1

Every message starts with a 128-byte little-endian header:

| Bytes | Field |
| --- | --- |
| 0-3 | Magic `MKVH` |
| 4-5 | Version, 1 |
| 6-7 | Kind |
| 8-23 | Handoff ID |
| 24-27 | Frame index |
| 28-31 | Frame count |
| 32-35 | Layer index |
| 36-39 | Flags; bit 0 means `crc` is set |
| 40-47 | First page row of the frame |
| 48-55 | Page rows in the frame |
| 56-63 | Payload bytes after the header |
| 64-67 | zlib CRC-32 of the payload |

The decoder is the link's client and asks; the producer is its service and answers:

| Request | Answers |
| --- | --- |
| `OPEN` (1), payload `{"checksum": true}` | `MANIFEST` (2) with the manifest as JSON; `WAIT` (3) when the export is not recorded yet; `ERROR` (4) with a reason |
| `PULL` (5) for frame N | `DATA` (6): one frame of page rows; `ERROR` |
| `CLOSE` (7) | `ACK` (8); the producer frees the pages |

The manifest describes one rank's export:

```json
{"protocol": 1, "handoff": "<hex>", "model": "org/model", "prompt_tokens": 18000, "first_token": 16384,
 "token_sha256": "<hex>", "block_size": 16, "tp_rank": 0, "tp_size": 2, "frames": 120,
 "layers": [{"index": 0, "kind": "attention", "shape": [101, 4, 16, 256],
             "dims": ["block", "head", "token", "kv_head_dim"], "dtype": "bfloat16",
             "heads": 4, "total_heads": 8, "head_size": 128}]}
```

- `token_sha256` is the SHA-256 of the prompt's token IDs as little-endian uint32 values, so the decoder can refuse
  pages computed for a different prompt.
- `block_size` is tokens per page row, and `first_token` is the prompt position of the first exported row.
- `shape` is the layer's exported page array: the cache tensor's shape with its block dimension cut to the exported
  rows. `dims` names each dimension: `block`, `token`, `head`, `head_dim`, `kv` (keys, then values), `kv_head_dim`
  (keys and values side by side) or `latent` (MLA rows of `latent_size` latent values, then `rope_size` rope values).
  The connector learns the labels from vLLM's own attention backend, so they follow the backend in use.
- A `DATA` payload is rows `[first, first + rows)` of one layer's page array, C-contiguous in the manifest's shape.
- `heads` are this rank's key/value heads out of `total_heads`. When there are more ranks than heads, each head is
  repeated on consecutive ranks.

Each link carries one call at a time: the decoder waits for an answer before sending the next request.

/* mcdma-rpcd: request/reply transport between applications on a Mac and a Linux peer over MCDMA RDMA.
 *
 * Applications never open a verbs context. Each talks to its local daemon through a shared-memory mailbox, and
 * only the daemons hold queue pairs, so an application that crashes or is killed cannot leave a QP behind. One
 * source builds on both ends: Linux libibverbs on the peer, Apple librdma plus the MCDMA provider on the Mac.
 *
 *   mcdma-rpcd listen [--owner USER] NAME DEVICE GID_INDEX PATH_MTU [ADDR:]PORT [REQ_MIB REP_MIB]
 *       The Linux end of one link. Mailbox /dev/shm/mcdma-rpc.NAME; TCP PORT takes one control connection from the
 *       connect end at a time, on every address unless ADDR names one; the Unix socket /tmp/mcdma-rpcd.NAME.sock
 *       takes one service ("MODE poll") and also answers STATUS and SHUTDOWN. Whoever reaches the control port can
 *       write into the mailbox, so bind it to the address the Mac connects to and let only the Mac through the
 *       firewall. Started as root, --owner gives the mailbox and socket to USER, whose services then attach without
 *       root.
 *   mcdma-rpcd connect PEER...
 *       The Mac end. PEER = name,host,port,device,gid_index,path_mtu[,req_mib,rep_mib]
 *       e.g. worker-a,192.0.2.21,18620,rdma_mcrdma0,0,4096,4,64
 *       One POSIX shared memory mailbox /mcdma-rpc.NAME and one thread per peer. The Unix socket
 *       /tmp/mcdma-rpcd.sock answers STATUS and SHUTDOWN (tears every verbs object down, then exits).
 *   mcdma-rpcd version
 *
 * MCDMA_RPCD_SOCKET replaces the Unix socket path. Mailboxes and sockets are owner-only: run the daemon as the user
 * whose applications use it. NAME is 1-20 characters of [A-Za-z0-9_-].
 *
 * Mailbox (protocol 1): request half [0, R), reply half [R, R + P); R and P are whole multiples of 4 MiB (default
 * 4 MiB each) and must match on both ends. Each half starts with a 4 KiB control page. A word is (seq << 32 | len);
 * seq 0 means empty. Payloads are written before their word.
 *   request half +0    connect end: client -> daemon, a request is staged. listen end: the request has landed
 *                +64   connect end: daemon -> client, 1 while the link to the peer is up
 *                +72   connect end: link generation, bumped each time the link comes up; a request staged before a
 *                      reconnect is lost, and a changed generation tells the waiting client so
 *                +256  R and P (u64 each), so applications know the layout
 *   reply half   +0    connect end: the peer's ready word (pull mode). listen end: the word it sends
 *                +64   connect end: the client's done word (written by the peer in direct mode)
 *                +128  listen end: service -> daemon, a reply is staged
 * The Mac registers each 4 MiB of its mailbox as its own MR (the largest registration the MCDMA provider has been
 * validated with) and hands the peer the table of its reply-half segments; every transfer is cut at those
 * boundaries.
 *
 * One call: the client stages the request and sets its word; the connect daemon WRITEs payload, then word, into the
 * peer's request half; the peer's service sees the word, computes and stages its reply; in direct mode (the
 * default) the listen daemon WRITEs the reply and then the client's done word straight into the Mac's reply half.
 * That relies on the Mac's NIC not reordering its PCIe writes (MCDMARelaxedOrdering = No, the default);
 * MCDMA_RPC_PULL=1 makes the peer send only a ready word and the connect daemon READ the payload instead.
 *
 * Services: a connection to the listen socket sends one line within five seconds. "MODE poll" registers the service,
 * answered "OK", or "ERR busy" while another service is registered; after "OK" the daemon sends nothing until the
 * registration ends, then "BYE" or a closed socket. The registration ends when the link drops, because requests in
 * flight are lost with it. "STATUS" and "SHUTDOWN" work on both sockets.
 *
 * STATUS answers "VERSION mcdma-rpcd 1 RELEASE", one line per peer and "END". The connect end reports
 *   PEER NAME up|down calls N failures N MiB N host=HOST port=PORT device=DEVICE req_mib=R rep_mib=P since=EPOCH
 * and the listen end reports its one link with device=, req_mib=, rep_mib=, since= and service=attached|none.
 *
 * Safety. The connect end takes its QP past INIT only after the listen end has answered HELLO from RTS, posts
 * nothing before its own RTS, gives up on a peer by destroying the QP inside a live process (never by exiting),
 * waits out every posted work request before destroying anything, and tears every object down on every exit path.
 * Every socket wait is bounded, so shutdown never hangs on a silent peer. One daemon serves each link name: a lock
 * file in /tmp is taken before any device or mailbox is touched, and a second daemon refuses to start. SHUTDOWN,
 * SIGINT and SIGTERM all stop it the same orderly way; SIGHUP is ignored, and SIGKILL, which skips the teardown,
 * must never be used. Stop the connect end before restarting any listen end.
